## Introduction
Ever since the arrival of Google Classroom (GC), it has been the go-to LMS for IIITD. However, there has been a need for IIITD to have its own LMS. Hence, the institute administration initiated the "BACKPACK" project, and you were contacted by BYLD to provide your inputs and develop the system.

## Features
The Backpack LMS supports the following features for both instructors and students:

### Instructor
- Upload and view lecture materials, including lecture videos (.mp4) and lecture slides (an array of strings)
- Upload and grade assessments, including assignments (problem statement) and quizzes (single question with a one-word answer)
- Specify the maximum marks for assignments (default 1 for quizzes)
- Close assessments to stop accepting submissions
- View and participate in course discussion forums by adding comments

### Student
- View uploaded lecture materials
- View assessments and submit solutions (assignments as .zip files and quizzes as one-word answers)
- Check if their submissions have been graded and view the marks received
- View and participate in course discussion forums by adding comments

## Usage

1. Create a dummy course with sample accounts for instructors and students.
2. Log in as an instructor to access the instructor menu and perform instructor-specific functions.
